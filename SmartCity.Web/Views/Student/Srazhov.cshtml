    You can be anyone you want in the real life. But sometimes you feel like you are missing something. Something really important.
    That's why Japanese Scientiests created the thing that everybode really needed. It's called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/waifu">Waifu</a> (i.e. Wife - Japanese anglicism)

    the best representatives of the world Waifus.
